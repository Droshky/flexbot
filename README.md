Company Funding:
Each company starts at stock value of .50 with a product of choice. To get funding, they use a command that gives them a random Venture Capital or they can transfer personal amounts of cash to their business account. The more funding, the more investments you can make towards your company. Like hiring different people for different jobs (Randomized Resumes/User chooses which person they want to hire).
