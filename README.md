# Company Funding:
Each company starts at stock value of .50 with a product of choice. To get funding, they use a command that gives them a      random Venture Capital or they can transfer personal amounts of cash to their business account. The more funding, the more investments you can make towards your company. Like hiring different people for different jobs (Randomized Resumes/User chooses which person they want to hire). 
  They can hire office space between the four different options:
    1) Small - holds 10 employees (150$ per month)
    2) Medium - holds 20 (300$ per month)
    3) Large - holds 40 (500$ per month)
    4) Capital - holds 100 (1000$ per month)
   They can own more than one office to hold more employees.
 
# Employees:
They hire a random employee, that employee has a set production level. That affects how much money you make based on the production level. You can fire if they have bad production level, or you can keep them and let them bring company stock prices up.
